Hi there! I'm Aziz Zayed, an MSc student at McGill University specializing in compilers and programming languages.
My current research focuses on equality saturation-based compiler optimization.
My most recent publication proposed a way to optimize MLIR using equality saturation on e-graphs: [DialEgg: A Dialect-Agnostic MLIR Optimizer using Equality Saturation with Egglog](/publications/dialegg), which I presented at CGO in March 2025.

With a diverse range of industry and research experiences, I've had the opportunity to work on impactful projects with world-class organizations:

- **Morgan Stanley**: I built machine learning models to detect fraud and anomalies in transactions, strengthening security for clients.
- **NVIDIA**: I designed and tested OmniGraph nodes for the Omniverse compute engine, improving ease-of-use and achieving a 20% increase in code coverage.
- **Amazon**: Hosted risk assessment ML models for detecting risky buys in the supply chain, reducing request latency by 35% and automating deployments.
- **AWS**: Enhanced GAN model support within [Deep Java Library](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary) (DJL), introducing real-world examples to improve DJL's usability for customers like Netflix.

 Check out my [resume](/home/Abd-El-Aziz_Zayed.pdf) for more details.

Outside of research and work, I love learning and building things (*i.e.* the engineering degree 🙂). Feel free to explore my [projects](/projects), [blog](/blog) and [publications](/publications) to see what I’ve been working on. I also enjoy diving into topics on religion and philosophy, as well as spending time exploring the beauty of nature.
