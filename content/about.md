Hi there! I'm Aziz Zayed, an MSc student at McGill University specializing in compilers and programming languages.
My current research focuses on building tools to optimize MLIR code using advanced equality saturation techniques.
This work has led to a publication, [DialEgg: Dialect-Agnostic MLIR Optimizer using Equality Saturation with Egglog](/publications/dialegg), which I will present at CGO in March 2025.

With a diverse range of industry and research experiences, I've had the opportunity to work on impactful projects with world-class organizations:

- **Morgan Stanley**: I built machine learning models to detect fraud and anomalies in transactions, strengthening security for clients.
- **NVIDIA**: I designed and tested OmniGraph nodes for the Omniverse compute engine, improving ease-of-use and achieving a 20% increase in code coverage.
- **Amazon (Supply Chain Optimization)**: Hosted risk assessment ML models for detecting risky buys, reducing request latency by 35% and automating deployments.
- **AWS**: Enhanced GAN model support within [DJL](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary), introducing real-world examples to improve DJL's usability for customers like Netflix.

 Check out my [resume](/home/Abd-El-Aziz_Zayed.pdf) for more details.

Outside of research and work, Iâ€™m love learning and building things (*i.e.* the engineering degree ðŸ™‚). Feel free to explore my [blog](/blog) and [projects](/projects) to see what Iâ€™ve been working on. I also enjoy diving into topics on religion and philosophy, as well as spending time exploring the beauty of nature.
